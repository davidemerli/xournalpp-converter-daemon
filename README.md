# Xournal++ Autoconverter Deamon (.xopp to .pdf)

## Description

I needed a way to convert .xopp files to .pdf automatically to avoid exporting manually every time I take notes.

This is used together with a cloud service to sync all my notes; keeping them also in a .pdf format allows notes to be read easily from every platform without having to open Xournal++.

## Install

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh <PATH-TO-FILES>
```

The `<PATH-TO-FILES>` is the path to the files that you want to convert.

**Defaults to current user home folder.**

## Uninstall

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./uninstall.sh <PATH-TO-FILES>
```
